# Retractions

Every claim this repository made and then killed, scoped or corrected — in the order it
happened, with what did the killing.

The rounds are numbered by when they ran, not by what survived. Read in that order the
repository looks like a sequence of findings. It is not. **Twelve of these fourteen entries
are a later round destroying an earlier round's conclusion, and in all twelve both rounds are
mine.** No outside challenger has run yet, so every row here is self-inflicted, and §
`ADVERSARY_FORECAST.md` records what I expect an outsider to add — written before one arrives,
so it scores my calibration rather than my luck.

This file exists because the git log has all of it and nobody reads a git log.

**Reading order matters.** Entries 1–4 are one failure mode: an instrument too weak for the
question, read as an answer. Entries 5–8 are a second: a name assigned before a stability check.
Entries 9–12 are a third and the most expensive — a group comparison that was partly measuring
how much of the survey each group had walked through. Entries 13–14 are mine about my own
framework, not about the data. Where a later entry supersedes an earlier one the earlier text
is **annotated, never rewritten** — a ledger that edits its own history is the thing it exists
to prevent.

| # | The claim | What killed or scoped it | What survived |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"The existing kink databases cannot separate Ivan's models A/B/C; phase 1 is hypothesis generation only"** — my opening position, stated before touching the data | `r13` leave-one-block-out. Person factors fitted on 31 domains predict which options a person endorses in a domain the factors never saw: **32/32 blocks positive, median gain +0.0340, permuted floor −0.0029, 31/32 above 3× floor** | Nothing of the claim. The correct half was narrower: the database cannot separate A from B *by generalisation tests*, because a dedicated module can be compositional (see #13) |
| 2 | **"Cross-domain transfer of individual structure is weak"** (`r08`, median \|r\| = 0.064 over 418 block pairs) | `r09`. PC1-vs-PC1 is blind to a shared subspace that is rotated differently in each block. Held-out CCA on the same residuals: **0.272 against a 0.055 permutation floor, 285/321 pairs ≥2× floor** | Nothing. Same data, same centering, opposite conclusion — the instrument was the finding |
| 3 | **Six named "factor coordinates"** printed by the joint rank-8 factorisation (`r11`) | `r11` itself, on the line below them. Held-out cell R² **+0.0497** against a gating-preserving permutation null of **+0.0504**. It tied its own null | The factors are inadmissible. `r12` established this was *not* instrument blindness — the person side recovers sex at r=0.509 — so the metric, not the instrument, was unfit |
| 4 | **"Multilingual duplicate options contaminate block 1, the largest block (n=15,250), and its zero overlap with the English twins shows two disjoint language subsamples"** (`r13`) | Counting. **One respondent. Four singleton options.** Zero overlap is what n=1 always looks like | A real hygiene item: singleton options exist and enter every factorisation as noise columns. Floor-filtered at n≥20 from `r17` onward (5 dropped) |
| 5 | **Four named coordinates from SVD on the concatenated blocks** (`r18`) | `r18`'s own stability control. All four named block 1 as their largest contributor; drop-top-block stability **0.39 / 0.70 / 0.25 / 0.38**. Variance-weighted factorisation returns the biggest block's coordinates | The method correction: MAXVAR generalized CCA, where block size enters only through a projector's rank. Stability went to 0.78 / 0.78 / 0.93 / 0.96 / 0.88 |
| 6 | **GCCA coordinate 1** (`r19`), agreement 0.299 | Its own per-block person-shuffle null: **0.302**. Observed sits *below* its null | Nothing. Reported dead rather than as a factor |
| 7 | **GCCA coordinate 5** (`r20`) | Deleting the 12 blocks contributing its top-25 loadings: stability **0.25** | Dropped. Coordinates 2–4 survive the same attack at 0.63 / 0.53 / 0.58 and survive deleting the whole 6-block fluid family at 0.94 / 0.92 / 0.73 |
| 8 | **"Schedule adherence is an individual trait"**, with correlates (biomale +0.093, own mean onset +0.100) — `r29` | Split-half over categories: r=+0.120, **Spearman–Brown 0.214**. Mostly measurement noise | The shared schedule itself: per-person rank agreement with the population ordering mean +0.232, **74.7% of 9,691 people positive against a 48.9% null, Cohen d 0.69**. The *adherence* correlates are correlates of nothing and were withdrawn before publication |
| 9 | **"Unit acquisition of a coordinate"** — my own hypothesis from `r26`, that categories sharing a GCCA coordinate were acquired together | `r27`. With preference similarity controlled: **COORD ΔR² +0.0008, t = −0.46**; TEMPO ΔR² **+0.0726, t = +4.59**. The two predictors correlate −0.028, so COORD is absent rather than hidden | Developmental tempo, which then survived its own binning null (observed t +4.19 vs null mean +0.50 ± 0.75, max +2.49) |
| 10 | **"The erotic grammar is largely modality-invariant"** (`r30`, deficit 0.0360 vs a 0.0965 sex deficit) | `r31`'s reference class. Nine person-variable splits measured identically: modality ranks **6th of 9**, median deficit 0.0313. It is typical, not exceptional | The animation split (drawn vs live-action, no real bodies) at 0.0123 raw / 0.0204 matched, 0.8 sd — bounded below sex-sized, which is the constraint on A that survives |
| 11 | **"How much porn you consume reorganises erotic grammar 2.4× more than sex does"** (`r31`, deficit **0.2285**, z=60) | `r32`: **corr(deficit, between-group gap in blocks entered) = +0.815** across the nine splits. Block-count-matched, pornhabit falls to **0.0871** — 38% survives. Then `r49` matched theta and sex as well: **0.0439** | The ordering **reversed**. Sex measured comparably is 0.0778. Anything published off the first pass would have said the opposite of what the data says |
| 12 | **"Self-reported porn-induced fetish acquisition has no structural signature"** (`r37`–`r38`, misfit rho +0.038, extremity +0.020, both null with stated MDEs) | `r39`, my own self-attack. Both measures live in within-block profile *shape*, and I had block-count matched — deleting the only place the effect could live. Unmatched: **n_categories 17.02 → 27.80 of 68, rho +0.2410, p 1.7e-177** | The null is correct **about shape**, with bounds (added misfit < 0.1 sd; extremity < 10%). It was a null about the wrong quantity, and the scope now says so |
| 13 | **"Model A predicts ordinary semantic features cannot predict what is sexual"** — my framing of Ivan's model A, used to rank the whole phase-1 design | Faces. A dedicated system (FFA, double dissociation) computes from ordinary image features and generalises perfectly to novel faces. Dedicated ⇏ non-compositional. The test is sound in one direction only: *failure to predict* supports A; *success* does not refute it | The reframe: rounds r07–r13 measure **compositionality vs item-specificity**, not content vs value. A/B separate on dissociation, acquisition and cross-modal transfer instead |
| 14 | **A norm/transgression parameter `n_i`** added to Ivan's operator, predicting that rarity-preference is a domain-general trait | `r09`. Cross-domain transfer of count-controlled rarity taste: **rho +0.065, 26 of 321 pairs above 0.2**. Not a domain-general trait as operationalised | The prediction that a normalisation manipulation should split subgroups by *sign* is untested and remains the cheapest available separator — it is in `PREREGISTRATION.md`, not here |

## What the pattern is

Three failure modes produced twelve of fourteen, and they are not independent:

**An instrument too weak, read as an answer** (#1, #2, #3, #6). In every case a null or a small
number was produced by a measurement that could not have shown the effect, and in three of four
the positive control that would have caught it existed and was run *afterwards*. `r12` is the
clearest: the person side of a factorisation recovers sex at r=0.509 while its held-out cell
metric ties its own null, because item covariance saturates that metric. **The instrument was
live and the metric was blind, and those are different verdicts.**

**A name assigned before a stability check** (#5, #7, #8). Naming is where the temptation is,
because a named coordinate reads as understanding. Every naming attempt in this repository that
was not immediately followed by a deletion test turned out to be reporting the largest block's
structure or an unreliable composite.

**A group comparison measuring survey coverage** (#10, #11, and it reached back into #12).
The release is a gated tree, so groups differ in how much of it they walked through, and
subspace congruence falls when coverage differs for reasons that have nothing to do with the
construct. This is undocumented anywhere I have read about this dataset and the correlation is
+0.815. It produced the single largest overstatement here — a factor of 5.2, and a reversed
ordering.

**And the fourth, which has only one entry and is the most dangerous** (#12): matching on the
confound deleted the effect. Match for a *shape* question, never for a *breadth* question, and
say which is being asked before matching. The same procedure is a control in one round and a
destroyer of evidence in the next.
